                        <p><span>Hey there,</span> I'm a 22 year old who recently completed his Computer Science degree and is look of an opportunity to develop his 
                            skills as Software Developer. At a young age I was always fascinated by technology from watching Sci-Fi movies to wanting to be the "real life" 
                            Tony Stark. I remeber when I wrote my first code I was so excited not only because the code worked but, that I was able to solve a problem. It was
                            then that I knew I was on the right path.</p>
                        <p>
                            In my university years I was fortunate to learn the fundamentals of programming and learn programming languages like Python, Java, SQL. I then taught
                            myself web development, using the fundamentals I have learnt. The reason why I decided to learn web development was because there is a demand and too many
                            resources to learn from. I also have a background in drama; acting, dancing and music, which taught me confidence and working in a team. Keeping fit is
                            also a big part in me life, I weightlift. Weightlifting has taught me consistancy and time management. In a nutshell this is me and I'm glad to
                            make your aquaintance.
